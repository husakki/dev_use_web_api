			 How to install USE
			 ==================
			
1. Requirements
---------------

USE is implemented in Java(tm). Therefore, it should run on any
platform on which a Java runtime system (e.g. OpenJDK) is
available. So far this has been tested mainly on Windows platforms
but it should work also on Linux. If you're trying to install USE 
on any other platform, you are on your own, although this should 
not be too difficult.

The distribution of USE comes with full sources. If you want to
compile USE yourself, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK)
version 15 or later (see https://openjdk.org) and Apache Maven 3.8
or later. Earlier versions of the JDK and Maven may work but have not
been tested.


2. Compilation
--------------

The distribution of USE comes with compiled sources. If you don't
want or need to recompile them, you can skip this step!

Otherwise, a simple "mvn compile" or "mwn verify" should compile 
the whole USE package. "mvn verify" will run all tests whereas
"mvn compile" just compiles.

Interaction with USE is done via a command line interface. This will
be much more comfortable if you have the GNU readline library
available on your system. USE provides an interface to the readline
library. For example, it allows bash or emacs-like editing of lines
and keeps a history file of recent input. Since the readline library
is platform dependent, the interface has to be compiled on your
system. Changes to the build file may be necessary for your
environment. If you don't have the readline library - don't worry.
USE will fall back to a simple input mechanism if it cannot find or
load the readline library at runtime.



3. Basic Installation
---------------------

There are no additional libraries required. You should only make sure
that the "java" program is in your program search path.


4. Running USE
--------------

The easiest way to start USE, is to use the shell script supplied with
this distribution (there is also a file use.bat for Windows). To use
this wrapper script, add the bin directory to your PATH environment
variable. Entering

	use -h

will give you a list of command line options. Also, look at the file
use.properties in the etc directory to see if you have to adapt some
settings to your environment. See the file README for a quick tour
that will help you getting started.
